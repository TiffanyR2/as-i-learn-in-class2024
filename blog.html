     creatures!

      They belong to a widely distributed and diverse 
     group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. 
     As an informal and colloquial grouping, they correspond to large members of 
     the infraorder Cetacea, which includes 
     all cetaceans apart from dolphins and porpoises. Interestingly, from a formal,
    cladistic perspective, dolphins and porpoises may also be considered whales

    Whales belong to two groups: toothed whales and baleen whales.
     Toothed whales have teeth and hunt prey, while baleen whales
    have plates of bristles that filter food from the water.
